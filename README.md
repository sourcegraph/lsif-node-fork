# TypeScript LSIF indexer

Visit https://lsif.dev/ to learn about LSIF.

## Installation

This project is a bugfix fork of [microsoft/lsif-node](https://github.com/microsoft/lsif-node) that has been altered to work with [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com).

Currently, this project is not published to npm and must be installed from source. To do so, simply run the following in the project root.

```bash
npm install
npm run compile
```

This will populate the files library files referenced by the wrapper scripts `./tsc/bin/lsif-tsc` and `./npm/bin/lsif-npm`.

## Indexing your repository

```
$ /path/to/lsif-node/tsc/bin/lsif-tsc --noContents -p . --stdout | /path/to/lsif-node/npm/bin/lsif-npm --stdin --out dump.lsif
```

In order to work correctly with LSIF dump roots on a Sourcegraph instance, you should **always** `cd` into the project root and supply `projectRoot` as the current directory (`.`). Supplying a `projectRoot` value other than the current directory will cause a mismatch in document URIs that will be unresolvable at query time.

Use `/path/to/lsif-node/tsc/bin/lsif-tsc --help` for more information.
